# Docs
### Setup script:
- Open terminal and go to the project folder
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Setting up Bot:
- To get started, you need to get a unique token for your own telegram bot. You can do this - by creating a bot via BotFather (using the following topic https://core.telegram.org/bots)
- Once the token has been obtained, set a new environment variable named **BOT_BINANCE** and the value of the token
- However, if you do not want to waste time and test the program - you can use a ready-made token `5099140563:AAHk0IGK-58J3koeoAWifXFP6069rSoyxyw`
### Start
#### Windows
- Use the `python app.py` command to run the bot
#### Mac
- Use the `python3 app.py` command to run the bot

After all the actions, you should see the following in the terminal (if everything is configured correctly of course)
```
Websocket has been started!
Bot has been started!
Websocket running...
```

# Workplace

To see the basic functionality of the bot - enter in the chat command /help or /start.
